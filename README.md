# Buck-boost-controllers
 This document introduces a Lyapunov-based robust control for a low-cost inverting DC-DC buck-boost converter, ensuring finite-time stability, disturbance rejection, and PWM signal generation. Simulations and real experiments validate the controller's effectiveness in enhancing stability.
